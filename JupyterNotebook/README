To run my models

If you wish to only test my models, simply run test.py with the model and data files I
 submitted in the same directory as test.py. Otherwise here are the step by step instructions
to run my programs

1) Download the raw Kaggle data and save it as "responses.csv"
2) Run train.py, this will preprocess the data and train the models
NOTE: This will save over any other models you have run from previous runs
3) This will output two models, and processes test data + labels and output them to files
4) run test.py (required the files from step 3) build by train.py) and it will print the results of running the models on the test data

As my submission, I sumbitted my two finished models along with the test data and labels associated with them. If you run train.py, you will overwrite these model and data files.
If you find that my submitted models are giving different results than what I describe in the
writeup, this is why. Please ensure this does not happen.
